# Ray Tracing Project

This project involves ray tracing implementation in C++ to generate realistic images through simulating the behavior of light. Follow the steps below to build and run the code.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- C++ compiler
- CMake

## Build Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https:https://github.com/AdityaPawar162/Projects.git
   cd ray-tracing

2. **Create a Build Directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir build  
   cd build  

3. **Configure with CMake:**  
   ```bash
   cmake ..  

4. **Build the Project:**
   ```bash
   make -j

## Running the Executable
Once the build process is complete, run the executable using the following command:  
   ```
   ./src/main
   ```

This will execute the ray tracing application, generating images based on the specified parameters in the code.
